		<h2>Pace</h2>
        <div id="sol1">While it is difficult to tailor a curriculum to fit the needs of each individual student, we as a team believe that classes would learn more effectively if the content were to be “hands on” rather than simply watching the demo on screen. Perhaps if students could follow along with Josh as he writes out code for different components they may find it easier to keep pace and understand what is happening in the class. Alternatively if some exercise files were prepared ahead of time and shared through FSO, the class could spend time working through the problems together which would aid in the awkwardness of trying to find a component to work on as well. These exercise files could be turned in by the end of class to show progress as well as attentiveness, and would be useful for future grading.</div>
			<p>Seems very slow, perhaps not steady. To some the components were easy, to some they may be spaced them out.

		<h2>Threading</h2>
        	<div id="sol2">While we are very interested in the components portion of the class, we feel as though they do not allow us to show our true potential as web developers. We have learned so much by this point in our degree, and we would like more opportunity to share and build upon what we have learned, not only in HTML/CSS but in JavaScript and JQuery as well. We believe it would be beneficial to allow the class the option of creating their own fully functional websites as too many students come to this point in the degree without ever having actually done so. This way, we can incorporate and improve upon all skills we have learned in past classes as well as have a professional portfolio piece to take with us from this class.
</div>
			<p>Should be using skills learned from previous courses to practice them and keep iterating on them. The course should not be solely about markup and CSS when we’ve learned some JS, and some design.
			</p>
			
			<p> Using less components but creating full functionality will incorporate multiple skills used in past classes.

		<h2>Portfolio</h2>
        	<div id="sol3">With a class titled Web Standards Project, many of us come into this class expecting to leave with some sort of completed project in hand. We believe having this option would be extremely beneficial to students. In our degree program, we spend a shockingly small amount of time building actual portfolio pieces and we believe that this class could help to change that. If we were to take the components we’ve built and turn them into a fully functioning website, much like this one, we believe that students would find it more beneficial than simply recreating singular components that we can not use in the future.</div>
			<p>The degree as it stands for people just coming in, they get portfolio work where it’s just mentioned to us, and there have already been changes to our degree which has ‘caused some scheduling hiccups.
			</p>
			<div class="solBtn">Solution</div>
			<p> Mandatory seminars during class hours to cover some gaps that we may have.

		<h2>SASS</h2>
       		<div id="sol4">I feel that SASS should be covered more than just having students explore it themselves. In lab I think it should be half lecture and it should be for SASS.</div>
			<p>SASS is not currently being taught in the degree but instructors are heavily encouraging learning it on your own. I think some time should be given to it.
