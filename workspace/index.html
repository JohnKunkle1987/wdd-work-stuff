		<h2>Pace</h2>
        <div id="sol1">While it is difficult to tailor a curriculum to fit the needs of each individual student, we as a team believe that classes would learn more effectively if the content were to be “hands on” rather than simply watching the demo on screen. Perhaps if students could follow along with Josh as he writes out code for different components they may find it easier to keep pace and understand what is happening in the class. Alternatively if some exercise files were prepared ahead of time and shared through FSO, the class could spend time working through the problems together which would aid in the awkwardness of trying to find a component to work on as well. These exercise files could be turned in by the end of class to show progress as well as attentiveness, and would be useful for future grading.</div>
			<p>We have collectively found ourselves concerned with the pace of this class. There were times in which what we were doing felt extremely slow or dragged out, while other times we were left feeling slightly confused by what we had been told or shown. Unfortunately, we sometimes found that the components we had picked were too simple for our liking. Other times, we found that we had picked components that we hadn’t the slightest idea of where to begin. We found ourselves very scattered, with some people stuck in certain places and others feeling extremely underwhelmed.

		<h2>Threading</h2>
        	<div id="sol2">While we are very interested in the components portion of the class, we feel as though they do not allow us to show our true potential as web developers. We have learned so much by this point in our degree, and we would like more opportunity to share and build upon what we have learned, not only in HTML/CSS but in JavaScript and JQuery as well. We believe it would be beneficial to allow the class the option of creating their own fully functional websites as too many students come to this point in the degree without ever having actually done so. This way, we can incorporate and improve upon all skills we have learned in past classes as well as have a professional portfolio piece to take with us from this class.
</div>
			<p>Throughout our degree program thus far, we have been taught a variety of skills that are each extremely important to know in order to become a professional web developer. Unfortunately, we find that our classes are very scattered in that we are taught a topic one month and do not touch on that topic again until several months later, where we find ourselves forgetting what we had previously learned. It is important to remember that at this point, we students have learned topics such as Javascript and JQuery in addition to our skills in HTML and CSS.

		<h2>Portfolio</h2>
        	<div id="sol3">With a class titled Web Standards Project, many of us come into this class expecting to leave with some sort of completed project in hand. We believe having this option would be extremely beneficial to students. In our degree program, we spend a shockingly small amount of time building actual portfolio pieces and we believe that this class could help to change that. If we were to take the components we’ve built and turn them into a fully functioning website, much like this one, we believe that students would find it more beneficial than simply recreating singular components that we can not use in the future.</div>
			<p>Upon hearing the title “Web Standards Project”, each of us believed that this class would be a portfolio-oriented class, although we have not found that to be true. Unfortunately for those of us who have been “grandfathered in” to our current degree curriculum, this means that we do not have any classes specifically geared toward our portfolio work. This is a very big problem as we can not be expected to be seen as professionals in the web development field without some type of portfolio showcasing our skills and what we have learned thus far.

		<h2>Frameworks</h2>
       		<div id="sol4">HTML and CSS frameworks are extremely important to know, but we spend so little time working with them in our degree program. Because this is one of our final Front-End oriented classes, we feel as though we should be offered the opportunity to learn about certain frameworks, particularly SASS, more in depth as we would otherwise be forced to learn them on our own. We recently had the opportunity in which Josh gave a short lecture on SASS, and so many of us genuinely appreciated it. We believe that this is a very important concept to learn before becoming professionals in our field, and we would appreciate the opportunity to explore it in depth.</div>
			<p>On a monthly basis we hear our instructors tell us that web frameworks are some of the most important things we can learn as professionals and that they will make our life much easier. However, most of these frameworks are not being taught in our degree program. Considering that in this day and age it is almost considered a “web standard” to know specific frameworks, we feel as though this class should have some time dedicated to touching upon these topics.

<p id="thanks">As a collective team, we would just like to take this time to address Edward and Josh and thank them for all that they have helped us to achieve this month. While every individual will always have some type of criticism, we would like to reiterate that we genuinely appreciate everything that you have done for us this month as well as having taken the time and put in the effort to work with our class on improving our skills. We hope to keep in contact with you both as we continue on through our degree program, and we hope that everyone involved this month will continue to put the “Pro” in “Progress”.
